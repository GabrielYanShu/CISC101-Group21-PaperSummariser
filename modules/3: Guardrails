Changelog:
  Added a flag for 'Evidence_mode'
  Added if, then loops for edge cases. 

- Flag missing/empty sections.
- Flag sections under 50 words.
- Flag variable 'Evidence_mode'
- Apply hallucination mitigation: only summarize existing text.
- Long-paper chunking: break into smaller units (PS2 context-window strategy).
- If 'Evidence_mode' = "strict", only include claims, equations, and results explicitly provided in the text
- If 'Evidence_mode' = "strict" and text contains insufficient information, respond "The source text provides insufficient detail to summarise this section in strict evidence mode."
- If length of section < 50 words, respond "Section too short: summary may be incomplete."
